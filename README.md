# Velociraptor Aerospace Dynamics IP Map

This archive contains code and data used to produce the map portion of the [Velociraptor Aerospace Dynamics IP Map](http://vad.solutions/ipmap/).

## Requirements

* [ipv4-heatmap](http://maps.measurement-factory.com/software/index.html), with the optional patch here against ipv4-heatmap-20140203 which modifies some of the visual aspects of the image output (transparency, perceptual rainbow, etc).
* A source of "sh ip bgp" data, e.g. from the [University of Oregon Route Views project](http://archive.routeviews.org/oix-route-views/)
